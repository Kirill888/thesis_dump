After running slam do (replacing prefix with whatever you used, i
usuallly use "dat").

> prefix_mat

This loads robot odometry(odo) observations (obs_all) and final
particle weights (pw).

>> [v,i] = max(pw);

Find the best particle (index i).

>> plot_robot(odo,'go-'); axis equal; hold on

Plot original odometry in green.

>> pplot(prefix,i,obs_all,'rs','r:','bo','b:','ro-',0.05)

Load particle with index i, and plot it's path in red, also plot
observations is red and map in blue. 0.05 is the length of the arrow,
when plotting odometry.

Note: odometry is actually odometry of the laser center, not the robot.
