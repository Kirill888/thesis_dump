HTSLAM models a map as a hybrid topological-metric structure: the
environment is divided into a number of regions, and a local metric
map is built for each region. The relative poses of the regions are
stored in a topological structure. There is no global reference
frame. Only relative poses of the nearby regions are stored.


%maybe enumerate 1,2,3
The structure is motivated primarily by the following.
First, dividing the world into a set of local maps appears to approximate the
way that humans reason \cite{psycho_kuipers82}. Second, it ensures
that the mapping scheme scales to large environments.  The scalability
limitations of a single map SLAM methods are well known
\cite{guivant03,guivant01,guivant02} and prohibit real-time SLAM for
maps of practical size.  The third and final motivation is that a
robot does not require a single, global, metric description of the
world.  For example, in the ``fetch me a beer from the refrigerator''
task, there is no need for the robot to know the position of the
fridge while it is in the living room.  The robot only needs to know
the position of the fridge when it is near to the fridge.

This chapter describes the HTSLAM approach to map modelling.  Some
aspects of the map design are motivated by the mapping procedures
developed in chapter~\ref{chpt:Mapping}, and will be clarified in chapter~\ref{chpt:Mapping}. %look in to wording
The following section describes the overall map structure.  Section~\ref{sec:local_map}
presents the methods used for modelling uncertainty within each local
map and section~\ref{sec:link} describes the methods used to model the
uncertainties of the topological links between maps.  Finally,
section~\ref{sec:region} discusses methods for defining the shape and
extent of each local region.

In HTSLAM, a map is a connected graph. Every node of the graph
corresponds to a region within the environment. Each node has its own
reference frame and stores a local, metric map of the region and some
representation of the extent of the region in the local coordinate
frame. An example of an HTSLAM map is given in 
\refFigure{fig:htslam_structure}. Note that there is no global reference
frame. The edges of the graph represent the stochastic coordinate
transformation between adjacent local maps
only. \refFigure{fig:htslam_structure_indoor} shows an example of an
HTSLAM map for an indoor environment, and
\refFigure{fig:htslam_structure_outdoor} for an outdoor environment.

The structure used in HTSLAM is similar to that of \Atlas\
\cite{bosse02atlas}, however HTSLAM uses different uncertainty
representations, both for the coordinate transformations between
adjacent map frames and for the local maps.  \Atlas, as a framework,
allows the use of an arbitrary mapping model, although the two implementations
that have been published include EKF SLAM and scan matching. \Atlas\
models the uncertainty in the coordinates of links or transitions between maps as Gaussian.
It therefore requires that spatial uncertainty in robot pose is represented by a 
Gaussian distribution. 

HTSLAM, on the other hand,  uses FastSLAM for local mapping.


Rao-Blackwellised particle filtering  the local maps (like FastSLAM),
permitting multi-modal modelling of the local map. HTSLAM also models
the transitions between maps using sets of particles.

A further difference between \Atlas\ and HTSLAM is that HTSLAM
maintains map extent information for every local map. This extra data
allows HTSLAM to perform map transitions and loop closing in a more
elegant manner (which will be discussed in
Chapter~\ref{chpt:LoopClosing}). In addition, HTSLAM explicitly
models the multiple hypotheses that arise during mapping, including
during loop closing, giving a more intuitively appealing and robust
approach.

The details of the uncertainty representation, both for each local map
and for the transitions between maps, are discussed in the next two
sections.  Section~\ref{sec:region} discusses methods for
determining the extents of each local map.

\section{Modelling Uncertainty within a Local Map}
\label{sec:local_map}

To understand how uncertainty is represented within the local map, one
needs to be familiar with the FastSLAM \cite{Montemerlo02d} mapping
scheme.
An overview of FastSLAM appers in
chapter~\ref{chpt:Overview}. In summary, FastSLAM uses particles to
sample the possible paths of the robot. A map is built for each
path. Particles are evaluated based on how well the measurements match
the map.  Regular resampling is used to prune unlikely paths.

The state $\s{k}{a}{m}$ of the $m$-th particle in the local map $a$
at time $k$ consists of the path of the particle within this local
frame, denoted \Xall{k}{a}{m}, and the map of the local environment
conditioned on the path, \map{k}{a}{m}:
\begin{eqnarray}
 \s{k}{a}{m}    &=& [\Xall{k}{a}{m}, \map{k}{a}{m} ] \nonumber \\ 
 \Xall{k}{a}{m} &=& [\x{0}{a}{m}, \x{1}{a}{m}, ... \x{k}{a}{m}] \nonumber \\ 
 \map{k}{a}{m}  &=& [\mape{a}{m}{1}, \mape{a}{m}{2}, ..., \mape{a}{m}{n}], \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
where $\x{k}{a}{m}$ is the pose of a robot for the $m$-th particle at
time step $k$ in local map $a$ and $\mape{a}{m}{n}$ is the position of
an $n$-th landmark in local map $a$. The landmark position is a
stochastic variable described by a Gaussian distribution. Note that
one does not have to store the whole path of a particle, since only
the most current pose of the particle is used in the mapping process.

A map is a probability distribution
$p(\map{k}{a}{m}|\Xall{k}{a}{m},\Zall{k}{a})$. Assume that the map consists of 
landmarks and that observations are independent. It follows that a map can be represented 
by a set of independent landmarks, each conditioned on the path of a particle
$p(\mape{a}{m}{}|\Xall{k}{a}{m},\Zall{k}{a})$. Note that there is a
different map for each particle. FastSLAM approximates
$p(\mape{a}{m}{}|\Xall{k}{a}{m},\Zall{k}{a})$ with a Gaussian.  For
point landmarks, the distribution is a two-dimensional Gaussian
describing the location of the landmark on the plane. Other landmark
characteristics can be incorporated into the stochastic
variable as well. For example, if one builds a map of trees, the landmark
might have one extra parameter for the diameter of the tree trunk.
Note that since there are multiple particles, the actual posterior
distribution of the landmark is a mixture of Gaussians. 
Only planar motion is considered in this thesis. The results,
however, can be readily extended to three-dimensional motion. Note
that, since the landmarks are estimated independently in FastSLAM,
there is no need to maintain the global covariance matrix for the
map.

Each particle makes its own data association decisions. As a result,
FastSLAM captures not only the uncertainty arising from 
continuous variables like robot pose and sensor measurements,
but also uncertainty due to discrete data association decisions. This
uncertainty is not represented in EKF approaches \cite{ekf_slam}.
The ability to capture data association uncertainty is advantageous since the data association is ambiguous in
most real-life situations.

When mapping of a given local map is complete, the maps of all
particles alive at the time are stored within the local map. This set
of maps is effectively a sample from all the possible maps given the
observations and odometry during the time robot was in the region.
Due to use of importance sampling, the sample from the maps is
expected to contain the most probable paths and their associated maps
(which are expected to be the better maps).

\section{Modelling Link Uncertainty}
\label{sec:link}
%Uncertainty of transformations

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=10cm]{Pics/fig_transition_model}
\end{center}
\caption[Modeling transition distribution]
{Relative locations of the adjacent maps are represented by a
  set of particles.}
\end{figure}

The spatial relationships between adjacent local maps are 
represented by a set of particles.  Whenever a new map is started, the assumption is made
that the current location of the robot is precisely known in the  coordinate frame of the new
map.\footnote{Often it is assumed that the robot is
at the origin.  Here the position of the robot is chosen to place the
origin of the coordinate frame suitably for describing the local map
extents.} Thus, the transition between the old and the new map can be
most directly computed from the estimate of the robot pose in the old
map (a set of FastSLAM path particles) and the pose in the new map
(known by assumption). The transition is then a stochastic variable
which is easily represented by particles. This is the chief
motivation for using a particle representation for the
transitions: the choice of representation makes the process of adding
new maps straightforward.

Note that when closing loops or, more generally, re-visiting maps,
there is no similarly easy method for transition determination, and samples
must be taken from other distributions. When closing
loops in HTSLAM, for example, transition samples are taken from the results of map
matching. In map matching, landmark matches are used to provide an estimate of
the transition function.

Define \tr{}{a}{b} to be a coordinate transformation between
coordinate frames $a$ and $b$, and the coordinate transform operator
\transit\ 
\begin{equation}
\x{k}{}{b} = \x{k}{}{a} \transit \tr{}{a}{b}.
\end{equation}
This operator projects the pose of the robot from one coordinate frame to
another.

The exact transformation between two maps is never known. It is
therefore a stochastic variable. In general, transitions and maps are
not independent, hence a joint probability needs to be stored. For
adjacent maps $a$ and $b$ this joint probability distribution is
$\prob{\map{}{}{a},\tr{}{a}{b}, \map{}{}{b}}$. Effectively,
the transition between the two adjacent maps captures a three-way
relationship between the two maps and the relative pose of the
reference frames of the two maps in a probabilistic manner. The exact
mechanism used to store the probability densities is described in more
detail in chapter~\ref{chpt:Mapping}.

It is worth noting that it is possible to derive the joint
probability $\prob{\map{}{}{a},\tr{}{a}{b},\map{}{}{b}}$ even for
non-adjacent maps $a$ and $b$ by merging probability densities along
the topological path joining the two maps.  The presence of loops in
the topological structure implies multiple paths between some of the
local map pairs. Therefore $\prob{\map{}{}{a},\tr{}{a}{b},\map{}{}{b}}$ can
be derived in several possible ways from the HTSLAM structure. This
adds a constraint to the HTSLAM structure which will be discussed in
more detail in the chapter on loop
closing (Chapter~\ref{chpt:LoopClosing}).

\section{Defining Region Boundaries}
\label{sec:region}

Each region has its own ``area of influence''. This area is defined by
a grid map in the local reference frame. The size of the grid cells is
of the order of the robot footprint. Landmarks are allowed to be
outside the ``area of influence''. However, if the robot leaves the
region, it will not be able to add new landmarks to the corresponding
map. All landmarks visible from the region are mapped within
this region. This implies that some landmarks will be mapped in
multiple maps.

By limiting the area of the local map, the HTSLAM algorithm achieves
two major goals: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Computational requirements per local map
are bounded, since there is a finite number of landmarks visible from
a finite area.
\item The residual uncertainty of the robot pose within the local region is bounded.
\end{enumerate}

Note that these grid maps define the area of influence of a particular
region. They are not meant to serve as occupancy grids, although when
operating indoors it is advantageous to align map regions with the
structure of the building.

Regions which are neighbours in the topological sense have their region
boundaries cropped to minimise the overlap. Grid maps
are defined in local coordinates, and must be transformed
from one reference frame to another in order to perform such
cropping. Since relative poses of the neighbouring maps are known with
high certainty, the transformation is performed using the mean of the
relative poses of the two regions.


Whenever a new map is started, an initial region for the map is defined.
The size and shape of the region depends on the environment and the
available sensors. For the indoor experiment with the laser range
sensor described in \refChapter{fixme}, free space information from the laser sensor is used to
initialise the region. For the outdoor data set, the region is set to a
rectangle of a fixed size aligned with the initial robot pose.

When mapping is complete for a given map, the region of influence is
cropped to minimise area that was not actually
mapped. This is achieved by computing a convex hull for all landmarks in a map,
mean of a landmark location is used and any uncertainty in landmark
location is ignored. Area that falls outside the convex hull is
removed from the region.


%TODO: accentuate the difference in approach from Atlas, that
%constantly monitors the pose uncertainty/performance of the
%mapper/size of the map.
