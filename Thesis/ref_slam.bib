		 Topological maps are favoured by some because they do
		 not have the global consistency problems however they
		 too have difficult correspondence problems due to

		 approach to closing cycles in a topological map. We use
		 both a global metric map and the topological map itself

		 and clustering them using the similarities that we just
		 computed. For the first part, trajectories are
		 estimated using an EKF formulation that will provide
		 the 3D trajectory up to a constant. To improve
		 accuracy, when occlusions appear, multiple hypotheses
		 are followed. For the second problem we compute the
		 distances between trajectories using a similarity based
		 on LCSS formulation. Similarities are computed between
		 projections of trajectories on coordinate axes. Finally
		 we group trajectories together based on previously
		 computed distances, using a clustering algorithm. To
		 check the validity of our approach, several experiments
		 using real data were performed.",
